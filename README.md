# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project with Streamlit GUI

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It features a Streamlit-based graphical user interface for interacting with the model, viewing training insights, and learning about core AI concepts.

## Core Components

*   **`cifar10_model.py`**: Defines the CNN architecture used for image classification.
*   **`cifar10_train.py`**: The script responsible for training the CNN model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It saves the best performing model to `cifar10_best_model.pth` and also generates training artifacts like `training_history.json`, `loss_plot.png`, and `accuracy_plot.png`.
*   **`streamlit_app.py`**: The main interactive application built with Streamlit. This is the primary way to interact with the trained model and explore its features.
*   **`cifar10_best_model.pth`**: The pre-trained model weights. This file is generated by `cifar10_train.py`.
*   **`training_history.json`**: Contains epoch-by-epoch training metrics (loss, accuracy for training and validation sets).
*   **`loss_plot.png` & `accuracy_plot.png`**: Visualizations of the training and validation loss and accuracy curves.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the necessary Python packages for the project.

## Features

The Streamlit application (`streamlit_app.py`) provides a user-friendly interface with the following key features organized into tabs:

### 1. Image Tester Tab
Test the trained AI model with images:
*   **Random CIFAR-10 Image Test:** Load a random image from the CIFAR-10 test set and see the model's prediction.
*   **Upload Your Own Image:** Upload an image (PNG, JPG, JPEG) and get the model's classification.
*   **Detailed Prediction Probabilities:** For each tested image, view the model's confidence in its prediction and a table/bar chart showing the probabilities assigned to all 10 CIFAR-10 classes, sorted by confidence.

### 2. Training Insights Tab
Understand how the model was trained and explore its performance:
*   **Training Performance Plots:** View saved plots of training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.
*   **Interactive Training Progress Chart:** An interactive line chart displaying epoch-wise training and validation loss loaded from `training_history.json`.
*   **Key Training Metrics:** See the total number of epochs trained, the best validation accuracy achieved, and the final training accuracy.
*   **Understanding Key Terms:** Definitions for common machine learning terms like Epoch, Loss, Accuracy, Training Set, Validation Set, and Overfitting.
*   **About the Model and Dataset:** Information about the CIFAR-10 dataset and the CNN model architecture used.

### 3. AI Concepts Tab
Gain a high-level understanding of relevant AI concepts:
*   **How AI 'Sees' Images (Interpretability):**
    *   Explanation of how CNNs learn hierarchical features (edges, textures, object parts).
    *   Introduction to the concept of model interpretability and Explainable AI (XAI).
    *   Brief mention of techniques like Saliency Maps, Class Activation Maps (CAM), and SHAP values.
*   **Model Limitations: Robustness and Adversarial Examples:**
    *   Discussion on the sensitivity of AI models to small input changes.
    *   Explanation of adversarial examples and their implications for AI safety and robustness.
    *   Links to external resources for further learning.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Train the Model (Optional if `cifar10_best_model.pth` and training artifacts already exist):**
    To train the model from scratch (or retrain it), run:
    ```bash
    python cifar10_train.py
    ```
    This will generate `cifar10_best_model.pth`, `training_history.json`, `loss_plot.png`, and `accuracy_plot.png`.

2.  **Run the Streamlit Application:**
    To launch the interactive GUI, execute:
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
    This will open the application in your web browser.
